Q2 is providing digital banking and lending solution to the banks.
Q2 is into delivering our mobile banking platoform and technology solution


The reason is the learning opportunities and carrer growth opportunities which my current
company promised me during interview I didn't get that on actual job. They have promised me
you will have lot of work on automation side like optimizing current automation suite,
fixing the failures integrating that with Azure devops and taking small small initiateves.
like sending these automation coverge reports manager and the team. Creating test plan
automation stratergy so these skills where aligning with my career goal to become lead

but here they have put me into one project where there is no scope of automation and less
manual testing, in mid they put in to another project where there is also only manual work

that is where I have realized that this is not going me to grow much in my career.

when i gone through JD for this role all the requirement which are mentioned in the JD were
helping me to achieve my long term goals.
